# rezasm
## A Rust port of [EzASM](https://github.com/ezasm-org/ezasm/tree/main)
"Rewrite it in Rust," and so we did.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a small-instruction-set programming language interpreter written in Rust with a GUI interface for inspecting the current state of the environment. This simple interpreted language would be able to demonstrate the concepts of a lower level assembly language while still being easier to write. The instructions would be intuitive and simple compared to MIPS (e.g., no system calls or immediate limits) and act upon virtual registers akin to other assembly languages.
